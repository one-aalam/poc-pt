# POC-PT

This is a basic project template for a web app written in ES6 and using some of mini JS libraries for creating ambitious Javascript applications.

**Install dependencies:**

```sh
npm install
```

That's it.

## Development Workflow

**Start the live-reload dev server:**

```sh
PORT=8080 npm run dev
```

Open up http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/ to see your app.
The app gets reloaded as files change.

## Deployment Workflow

To deploy your static app, upload the contents of `build/` to a web server.

Or, push this repo to heroku. `http-server` is used to serve the files in `build/`.
